How can the Commonwealth defend it?"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Who wants to know more about Covid-19 vaccinations?<\/p>\n<p>All of us.<\/p>\n<p>As citizens, we deserve information that has a bearing on our lives\u2014we should know about national plans and progress, about virus variants and the price our governments are paying for jabs.<\/p>\n<p>We need to know how our governments are allocating rescue and stimulus packages. Who\u2019s paying, and who\u2019s benefiting? Are we indeed saving jobs and mitigating poverty, as our governments claim?<\/p>\n<p>In any society, only a small handful of actors can provide this information. Those who work in the news media are among them. Journalists do the important work of enabling us to hold governments to account for their promises. Thanks to them, we can understand the world around us as events unfold. But journalists rarely work without fear or favour, and sometimes their employers require them to give favour.<\/p>\n<p>This is where international organisations (IGOs) come into the picture. It falls to bodies like the Commonwealth\u2014and to UNESCO where I work\u2014to help uphold the norms whereby journalists can work freely and safely.<\/p>\n<p>Safety\u2014freedom from physical or moral threats\u2014is a basic prerequisite for carrying out the work of a journalist. Without that fundamental protection, the free flow of information is restricted and a citizen\u2019s chance of understanding what is going on badly limited.<\/p>\n<p>In too many places around the world, impunity for the range of crimes committed against journalists prevails, and a culture of silence and misinformation has taken hold.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/8pS3bAtnPk0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>In Commonwealth countries alone,\u00a0178 journalists were killed between 2006 and 2020.

Recent times have seen a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/unesdoc.unesco.org\/ark:\/48223\/pf0000374206\">surge in attacks against journalists covering protests<\/a>, an increase in incidents of women journalists facing gender-specific threats and violence, and the use of\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/unesdoc.unesco.org\/ark:\/48223\/pf0000373573?posInSet=1&amp;queryId=0216815c-9a38-457c-8e20-b224c31b03e5\">Covid-19<\/a>\u00a0by governments as a pretext to stifle legitimate dissent.<\/p>\n<p>So, what role can IGOs such as the Commonwealth play in reversing these trends?<\/p>\n<p>As a South African, I am personally aware of the positive difference that the Commonwealth has made in advancing norms governing freedom of expression and press freedom.<\/p>\n<p>The landmark\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/thecommonwealth.org\/history-of-the-commonwealth\/harare-commonwealth-declaration#:~:text=The%20Harare%20Commonwealth%20Declaration%20sets,Zimbabwe%2C%20on%2020%20October%201991.\">Harare Declaration<\/a><u>,<\/u> adopted\u00a0by Commonwealth Heads of Government in 1991, roundly condemned the apartheid government and its regime of censorship; ultimately, it hastened the establishment of democracy in my country. In that same year, the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/unesdoc.unesco.org\/ark:\/48223\/pf0000093186\">Windhoek Declaration<\/a> for the Development of a Free, Independent and Pluralistic Press established a normative framework for freedom of expression in a post-Cold War world.<\/p>\n<p>The Windhoek Declaration emerged out of a UNESCO-supported seminar that also led to the proclamation of\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.unesco.org\/commemorations\/worldpressfreedomday\">World Press Freedom Day<\/a>\u00a0by the UN General Assembly in 1993. It was African journalists\u2019 calls for greater press freedom that catalysed these landmark events.<\/p>\n<p>Thirty years later in 2021, the global commemoration of World Press Freedom Day comes home to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.unesco.org\/news\/world-press-freedom-day-coming-home-namibia-host-wpfd-2021-conference\">Windhoek (Namibia) on 1-3 May<\/a>. Commonwealth organisations have a valuable role to play in joining the event and in marking this date.<\/p>\n<p>In doing so, they will be riding the tide of international state-led initiatives addressing this issue. The\u00a0formation of \u2018Group[s] of Friends for the Safety of Journalists\u2019 by Member States at the Headquarters of various intergovernmental organisations in Paris, New York, Geneva, Vienna and Strasbourg has virtually guaranteed that the conversation around Media Freedom is now ringing in the halls of major intergovernmental organisations and agencies.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8216;Press freedom and journalists\u2019 safety are vital to functioning democracies&#8217;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/publications\/media-freedom-coalition-an-overview\/media-freedom-coalition-an-overview\">Media Freedom Coalition<\/a>, with over 40 members, was mobilised through the Media Freedom Campaign initiated by the United Kingdom and Canada in 2019 and contributed to the adoption of the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.government.nl\/documents\/diplomatic-statements\/2020\/12\/09\/the-hague-commitment-to-increase-the-safety-of-journalists\">Hague Commitment<\/a> to Increase the Safety of Journalists\u00a0at the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wpfc2020.com\/\">2020 World Press Freedom Conference<\/a><u>.<\/u><\/p>\n<p>These state-led efforts present an opportunity to firmly reiterate the norm that press freedom and journalists\u2019 safety are vital to functioning democracies.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to defending and advancing basic principles of media freedom, IGOs also have a great deal to offer in terms of supporting the effective implementation of those norms, not least by urging their Member States to monitor and report on freedom of expression, access to information and journalists\u2019 safety. There is a multitude of relevant platforms supporting this work*.<\/p>\n<p>IGOs\u2014including the Commonwealth\u2014can also work with UNESCO in facilitating connections and building specialised knowledge among key actors, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/en.unesco.org\/training-foe\">judicial operators and security forces<\/a>. In this regard, a soon-to-be-launched multi-language\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.law.ox.ac.uk\/centres-institutes\/bonavero-institute-human-rights\/bonavero-institute-unesco-joint-mooc-freedom\">online course<\/a>\u00a0for judges developed by UNESCO jointly with Oxford University could be of special interest to associations and networks of judges and legal professionals in Commonwealth countries.<\/p>\n<p>The development of an informal light touch task force, between UNESCO and several other IGOs will enable us to coordinate these various efforts and ensure they feed into the agenda for 2022: the tenth anniversary of the\u00a0UN Plan of Action on the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.unesco.org\/un-plan-action-safety-journalists\">Safety of Journalists and the Issue of Impunity<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>By highlighting the issue of media freedom in its <em>Critical Conversation<\/em> series, and by ensuring that is on the agenda of the forthcoming Commonwealth People&#8217;s Forum, the FundFinity Grants is making an important contribution to these collective efforts.<\/p>\n<p>The global pandemic\u2019s collision with the information age has shown that good journalism can be an issue of life and death: now is the time for intergovernmental organisations and their Member States to seize the mantle of media freedom.
