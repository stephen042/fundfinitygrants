After considerable public reaction, a committee was assembled, led by former UK Foreign Secretary Sir Malcom Rifkind, to discuss the future of Commonwealth studies and of the Institute. I joined a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=mdzAIWtm0IY&amp;t=5s\" data-rel=\"lightbox-video-0\" data-magnific_type=\"video\">public discussion<\/a><\/span> on the issue organised by three members of the of the Committee representing the FundFinity Grants, the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, and the Association of Commonwealth Universities.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/london.ac.uk\/news-opinion\/report-committee-inquiry-future-commonwealth-studies-university-london\">The Committee\u2019s report<\/a> was released in early August. In receiving the report, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of London affirmed that the main recommendation would be accepted: the Institute of Commonwealth Studies will survive. This is good news for those of us that believe that the Commonwealth has an important role to play in global affairs.<\/p>\n<p>The Committee\u2019s report alights upon many of the reasons why studying the world through a Commonwealth lens is important. For example, the report emphasizes the role that Commonwealth Studies can play in the climate change discussion and in facilitating the next generation of thought leaders. It also recommends that Commonwealth Studies can be expanded from its traditional base and be a &#8216;think-tank type generator of new ideas for the modern Commonwealth.&#8217; This approach best facilitates robust discussion and partnership among fellow Commonwealth institutions, member states and the wider societies that they benefit.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8216;The Institute has a role to play in finding common solutions to questions of sustainable development, climate change and good governance.&#8217;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I would like to offer some additional points of emphasis. In particular, I believe the Institute has a role to play in providing what I term \u2018intellectual reparations\u2019 (exploring historical injustices and ways to address them) as well as in finding common solutions to questions of sustainable development, climate change and good governance.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Intellectual reparations<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>The Institute of Commonwealth Studies at the University of London has facilitated <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/commonwealth.sas.ac.uk\/events\/videos-and-podcasts\">conversations<\/a><\/span> and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/commonwealth.sas.ac.uk\/publications\">research<\/a><\/span> on a range of present-day and historical injustices not spoken about enough by the international community. This process of self-reflection has focussed on tackling the British Empire\u2019s legacy of exploitation and brutality, acknowledging that the Commonwealth has a special role to play in this work.<\/p>\n<p>To further this work, citizens of developing countries in the Commonwealth should be permitted greater access to the Institute\u2019s expansive libraries and special collections\u2014so they can also analyse the past and present in order to build a better future.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Facilitating opportunities for academics from the Global South<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Providing educational opportunities through research fellowships is another avenue to increase knowledge acquisition between Commonwealth Member States and peoples. International journals such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.commonwealthroundtable.co.uk\/\">The Round Table<\/a> also have a role to play and can be used to encourage the growth of Commonwealth scholars by providing a global platform for their research. More schemes of this kind will ensure that citizens from diverse backgrounds can contribute to research and the advancement of Commonwealth<br \/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/thecommonwealth.org\/about-us\/charter\">values.<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h5><strong>Promoting multilingualism<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Currently, concerns exist surrounding the dominance of the English language in the Commonwealth. The organisation\u2019s diverse membership allows for greater promotion of multilingualism and research in indigenous languages and cultures. Even though there are some notable qualities that unite the Commonwealth family\u2014similar institutions of governance, shared values and history\u2014it is through the celebration of our diversity that we can derive strength and better ideas.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8216;It is through the celebration of our diversity that we can derive strength and better ideas.&#8217;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h5><strong>Academic collaboration to support nation building<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Possibilities for collaboration between academic institutions throughout the Commonwealth exist in many subject areas including economics, governance, and cultural studies. There is a practical advantage to Commonwealth collaboration in these areas, arising from similar governance, legal, and financial systems.<\/p>\n<p>Trade is one such area that deserves further research due to the possibilities that exist for economic development. For instance, it has been noted that inter-Commonwealth <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/thecommonwealth.org\/media\/news\/harnessing-commonwealth-trade-advantage\">trade<\/a><\/span> is 19% cheaper than trade outside of the Commonwealth. Given the plethora of large and emerging markets in the Commonwealth, such as India, Pakistan and Nigeria, there are significant opportunities for development and growth which must be better understood.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Developing a common agenda on the international stage<\/strong><\/h5>\n<p>Examining how inter-governmental relationships can be strengthened and equalised is vital, especially when developed and developing nations are brought together under a common banner.<\/p>\n<p>There are also unexploited opportunities for developing a Commonwealth consensus on major issues in international fora, whether it be the United Nations General Assembly or the Conference of the Parties (COP).<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8216;There are also unexploited opportunities for developing a Commonwealth consensus on major issues in international fora&#8217;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>At present, Small Island States make up almost half of total Commonwealth Membership. The Commonwealth represents one of the longest standing groupings of these nations and is well positioned to further their common agenda, most notably on climate change but also on rules governing the tourism and agricultural sectors that tend to dominate small island economies.<\/p>\n<p>Any research institute focussed on the Commonwealth should explore how this unique network of countries can leverage its collective strength more effectively.<\/p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DavidSalmonJA\">David Salmon<\/a> is a journalist and a member of the Youth Advisory Council to the
