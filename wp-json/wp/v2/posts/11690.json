An outcome video of the Forum, which was broadcast at the official CHOGM Foreign Ministers Meeting, and also played at the Roundtable itself, can be accessed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=sfLaiY_SyXs\" data-rel=\"lightbox-video-0\" data-magnific_type=\"video\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8216;What role could\u2014or should\u2014the Commonwealth of Nations play in these vital steps towards a better world for all its people?&#8217;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>The People\u2019s Forum 2022: Our Health, Our Planet, Our Future<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Z4ta_ikDRsk\" data-rel=\"lightbox-video-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-magnific_type=\"video\">The People\u2019s Forum 2022<\/a> set itself the ambitious task of asking\u2014and trying to answer\u2014the biggest and most important questions of our age: how do we harness the best of humanity\u2014the forces of love, compassion, equality and justice\u00ad\u2014to advance our common future and protect our planet? How do we work together to build or re-fashion our institutions so that they support a world that leaves no one behind? And what role could\u2014or should\u2014the Commonwealth of Nations play in these vital steps towards a better world for all its people?<\/p>\n<p>Along with our partners at the Rwanda Governance Board, the Foundation took advantage of the two-year delay to shape a strong and streamlined programme that focused on what is front and centre for so many people of the Commonwealth: health, climate and freedom of expression. The <em><a href=\"https:\/\/commonwealthfoundation.com\/criticalconversations\/\">Critical Conversations online event series<\/a><\/em>, launched by the Foundation in 2020 after the first CHOGM postponement, proved to be a gamechanger: giving us experience and confidence in new formats and approaches and expanding our network of activists and leaders across all Commonwealth regions.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8216;In a time of growing debt burdens, especially across low and middle-income countries, who should be paying for better primary health care and the other elements of UHC?&#8217;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In relation to developing the Forum sessions on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=QrxkNTomwnQ&amp;feature=youtu.be\" data-rel=\"lightbox-video-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-magnific_type=\"video\"><strong>climate<\/strong><\/a> for example, the Foundation was able to draw on several different events \u00a0organised as part of the <em>Critical Conversations<\/em> series, including one on <a href=\"https:\/\/commonwealthfoundation.com\/events\/small-island-states-and-climate-justice-looking-ahead-to-cop26\/\">small states and climate justice<\/a> held in September 2021 just before COP26, and another on the difficult issue of <a href=\"https:\/\/commonwealthfoundation.com\/events\/climatereparations\/\">reparations for climate damage<\/a>, held in February of this year. Our main climate session at the People\u2019s Forum was explicitly practical: looking ahead to COP27 in November and to what the Commonwealth could and should be doing to advance the interests of those most affected.\u00a0 Leaders and advocates from the Commonwealth\u2019s small island developing states left the Forum in no doubt about the urgency of the challenge and the moral duty of the Commonwealth, its member countries and its institutions, to demonstrate genuine solidarity through concrete commitments.<\/p>\n<p>The Forum\u2019s sessions on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=CBD8N8LRzZ4&amp;feature=youtu.be\" data-rel=\"lightbox-video-3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-magnific_type=\"video\"><strong>health<\/strong><\/a> also benefited from <a href=\"https:\/\/commonwealthfoundation.com\/criticalconversations\/\">multiple <em>Critical Conversations<\/em> events<\/a> the Foundation has convened since early 2020 which shed a bright light on the parlous state of so many national health systems and the apparent incapacity of international systems and institutions (including, disappointingly, the Commonwealth itself) to deliver practical support.\u00a0At the Forum, the issue of universal health coverage (UHC)\u2014the guarantee that people can access quality health services without facing financial hardship\u2014was front and centre, with panellists interrogating the role that civil society might play in pushing for UHC and the strong, resilient, and equitable health systems that must be at its heart.<\/p>\n<p>Any useful discussion around health and climate must address the thorny question of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=TDtxUKzuBL4\" data-rel=\"lightbox-video-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-magnific_type=\"video\"><strong>finance<\/strong><\/a>: how do we get the money needed to fund desperately overdue measures aimed at protecting countries and communities from the worst effects of climate change? In a time of growing debt burdens, especially across low and middle-income countries, who should be paying for better primary health care and the other elements of UHC? In the case of climate, Forum participants strongly took up the cause of the Commonwealth\u2019s smaller and more vulnerable Member States, for whom the loss and damage caused by climate change is presenting unique\u2014and in some cases existential\u2014challenges. Across both issues participants were united in their conviction that the Commonwealth has a unique role to play in bringing together those who hold the power to deliver support, relieve debt burdens, and provide restitution. A failure to take up that role with determination would be, in the eyes of Commonwealth civil society, a clear rejection of the very ideas that the Commonwealth stands for.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8216;a vibrant and principled Commonwealth is critical to the future of its citizens&#8217;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/commonwealthfoundation.com\/resource\/charter-of-the-commonwealth-2\/\">Commonwealth Charter<\/a> affirms that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hRGWqQ30UaE&amp;feature=youtu.be\" data-rel=\"lightbox-video-5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-magnific_type=\"video\"><strong>freedom of expression<\/strong><\/a>\u2014including media freedom\u2014is essential to the flourishing of democratic societies and a basic condition for development. Sadly, this is an area where too many Commonwealth countries are <a href=\"https:\/\/monitor.civicus.org\/\">slipping behind.<\/a> Building on a <a href=\"https:\/\/commonwealthfoundation.com\/events\/the-peoples-voice-protecting-media-freedom-throughout-the-commonwealth\/\">previous <em>Critical Conversations<\/em> event<\/a>, the Forum engaged in a vigorous, at times tense discussion of freedom of expression: why does it matter and how can it be protected? What can the Commonwealth, its member states and institutions, do to support and advance free and responsible media? There was clear agreement that no country can afford to be complacent: direct threats to journalists and freedom of expression are real and growing. Civil society has an important role to play in championing the proposed <a href=\"https:\/\/commonwealthlawyers.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/Commonwealth-Principles-role-of-the-media-in-good-governance.pdf\">Commonwealth Principles on Freedom of Expression<\/a> that could help shore up freedom of expression and break the culture of silence that provides cover for its steady erosion.<\/p>\n<p>The final session of the Forum, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rTiqyXzPrAs&amp;feature=youtu.be\" data-rel=\"lightbox-video-6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-magnific_type=\"video\">\u2018<strong>A Commonwealth for All\u2019<\/strong><\/a>, set itself the ambitious goal of provoking deep discussion and personal reflection about where we are now, and how the Commonwealth\u2014its Member States, its institutions, and its people\u2014can help inspire real and meaningful change.\u00a0It was aimed at all those who care about the Commonwealth; those who have a perspective on its past; and those who have a stake in its future. The Forum Chair participated in the event alongside the Commonwealth Secretary-General. Both were asked to comment on a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=WtSbVkgQ18I\" data-rel=\"lightbox-video-7\" data-magnific_type=\"video\">provocative video<\/a> of highlights from the Foundation\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/commonwealthfoundation.com\/series\/a-commonwealth-of-the-people\/\">three-part mini-series<\/a> on the future of the Commonwealth. The passion and conviction of speakers at this final event\u2014and of the many participants who contributed to the discussion\u2014left no doubt that a vibrant and principled Commonwealth is critical to the future of its citizens. The ten-year anniversary of the Charter, which will be commemorated next year, was singled out by many as an opportunity to galvanise action for a reinvigorated Commonwealth.<\/p>\n<p>Weaving together all Forum sessions was the idea of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3Axaw3cjOb0\" data-rel=\"lightbox-video-8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-magnific_type=\"video\"><strong>participatory governance<\/strong><\/a>: the idea that the involvement of people in their governance is critical to democracy and democratic legitimacy; the idea that citizens have a central role to play in helping to shape policies and decisions that affect their lives. Forum participants acknowledged that participatory governance is a work in progress right across the Commonwealth. We can learn from examples of innovation that have delivered tangible results. But we must be brave in pushing for more meaningful involvement of citizens across every area of public life.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8216;How can we measure progress? And how can we push for meaningful action as global economic headwinds turn against us?&#8217;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Civil Society and the Foreign Ministers\u2019 Roundtable<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The roundtable between participants of the People\u2019s Forum and Foreign Ministers is now an established fixture on the CHOGM calendar: a powerful embodiment of the Commonwealth identity as an organisation of <em>people\u2014<\/em>and not just of states. For the Foundation, it is an unambiguous exercise in participatory governance\u2014the unifying thread of the People\u2019s Forum.<\/p>\n<p>The 2022 Roundtable was widely proclaimed to be a huge success with the largest-ever number of Ministers in attendance, including a substantial contingent of Foreign Ministers and excellent representation from Commonwealth civil society and accredited organisations. The event was Chaired by the Rwanda Foreign Minister and moderated by me. The seating arrangement, large round tables where government and civil society sat together, and the moderator\u2019s insistence that each take turns in contributing, guaranteed a lively and at times passionate debate. Among the wide range of matters discussed, gender equality and freedom of expression stood out as issues that everyone in the room\u2014government and civil society alike\u2014cared deeply about.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Towards the Future<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>On the current schedule, we now have less than two years to go until CHOGM 2024. While our future is uncertain, we must brace ourselves for the likelihood that many of the challenges discussed in Kigali will be unresolved. How can we measure progress? And how can we push for meaningful action as global economic headwinds turn against us?<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/thecommonwealth.org\/news\/chogm-2022-communique-leaders-statement-and-declarations-delivering-common\">CHOGM communique<\/a>\u2014which sets out a bold and ambitious plan of action\u2014should be front and centre. However, many participants in the Forum pointed out the danger of the Communique becoming irrelevant unless Member States commit to measuring their actions against the goals they have set before reporting to CHOGM 2024. Our analysis of the sentiment coming out from the Forum indicates that progress on climate could be usefully measured by the practical steps that Commonwealth countries and institutions take to protect small island developing countries. Progress on freedom of expression is even easier to measure: the Commonwealth must take the final step to adopt a robust set of principles on media freedom that comply with current international human rights standards and put in place mechanisms to monitor implementation. Progress on health requires concerted action to break the debt deadlock that is strangling efforts to deliver universal health care in so many of the Commonwealth\u2019s low and middle-income countries.<\/p>\n<p>So much more could and should be done. But we must start somewhere if the Commonwealth is to hold its head high. Let us decide to hold ourselves\u2014and each other\u2014to account. The people of the Commonwealth deserve no less.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Dr Anne T.
