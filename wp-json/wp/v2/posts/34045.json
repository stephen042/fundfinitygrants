The programme, which received extra funding from the Government of Canada, provided financial assistance to civil society organisations in Commonwealth countries. The grants targeted organisations that sought to work constructively and closely with governments in recovery and rebuilding efforts.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Partners were tasked with delivering projects in a unique and challenging context. As governments adopted large-scale &#8211; and sometimes draconian &#8211; emergency pandemic measures, the space for civil society to operate shrank. For example, restrictions on movement often limited access to those most in need of help. The situation also took its toll on the physical and mental well-being of the dedicated staff and volunteers running the projects and organisations.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">&#8216;Partners were tasked with delivering projects in a unique and challenging context&#8230; as governments adopted large-scale emergency pandemic measures.&#8217;<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">All 10 projects funded by the extra contribution from the Government of Canada overcame these and many other obstacles to be able to document real impact. Partners reported increased awareness of key issues relating to Covid-19 within their beneficiary communities. The projects also helped marginalised communities to better advocate for their rights surrounding Covid-19. Most notably, some projects actually contributed to a significant change in government Covid-19 policy and pandemic response.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Below is a snapshot of just a few of the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/commonwealthfoundation.com\/projects\/?post_tag=416\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">funded<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> projects.

Their collaborative efforts\u2014which brought disabled peoples\u2019 organisations together with the Ministry of Health\u2014helped Government reach out to people with disabilities and factor their needs into Bangladesh\u2019s Covid-19 Preparedness and Response Plan. This led to 2,000 people with disabilities, their parents and caregivers being registered for the Covid-19 vaccine and accessing the government support they were entitled to in the form of cash, food parcels, soaps, masks and jabs.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">&#8216;All 10 projects overcame many other obstacles to document real impact.&#8217;<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The South African Government\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.za\/services\/social-benefits\/social-relief-distress\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Social Relief of Distress<\/span><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> (SRD) grant was a lifeline for thousands of South African citizens deprived of work during the pandemic\u2014yet the initial income threshold meant as many as 10.5 million poorer citizens couldn\u2019t access the funds they needed.

On 16 August 2022, the Department of Social Development announced amendments to the SRD grant regulation that addressed two of the key issues raised in Black Sash\u2019s campaign, dramatically widening access to the government\u2019s life-saving programme. The R350 monthly income threshold was raised and the reliance on bank account verification checks, which had prevented many families with shared bank accounts from accessing the SRD, was overturned.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">In Ghana, <\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\">electricity<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> shortages prevented rural communities <\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\">from receiving television and radio updates on Covid-19 relief programmes. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/commonwealthfoundation.com\/project\/enhancing-citizens-participation-for-effective-covid-19-responses\/\"><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Women Integrated Development Organisation<\/span><\/b><\/a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> gathered feedback from 20 rural communities in the Upper West and Bono East regions of Ghana on Covid-19 relief programmes, which was shared with regional authorities. <\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\">The Ghana Enterprise Agency organised community awareness sessions to learn about accessing government support. <\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">This allowed over 564 women and 213 persons with disabilities in rural communities to submit applications for government support.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Constructive engagement\u2014where civil society and government work hand in hand towards a common end \u2014lies at the heart of what the\u00a0FundFinity Grants believes in and helps to support. Three years after it all began, we are still to fully understand the social and economic costs of the pandemic. However, some things are already abundantly clear. We understand very well that the\u00a0pandemic \u2013 and responses to the pandemic \u2013 affected\u00a0people and countries\u00a0very differently. Across the Commonwealth, it was the poor and the marginalised who were most at risk. These projects made a difference. But perhaps their most valuable contribution\u00a0was the clear confirmation that cooperation and collaboration between civil society and government can work to transform lives. <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">These are just a few notable achievements of our Covid-19 grants partners.
