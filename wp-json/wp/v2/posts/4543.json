In this way, according to Pikitup, recyclables remain clean and can be resold more easily.\u00a0 Effectively, however, this would exclude waste-pickers from the recycling service they have provided for decades at no cost to the city and\u00a0negatively affect the income that they earn from selling recyclable material.<\/p>\n<p>WIEGO has been working with the waste-pickers of Johannesburg who collect, sort, separate and recycle the City\u2019s waste from the main landfills as well as from the street sides.\u00a0 There are 6,000 to 10,000 people in Johannesburg who depend on waste-picking work.\u00a0 Unemployment in South Africa has reached a record 27.7 percent, so excluding wastepickers will create additional hardship.\u00a0 By giving recycling contracts to private companies, the city is opting for a private system, when a less costly, more socially responsible and environmentally\u2013friendly solid waste management programme, including waste-pickers, is possible.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wiego.org\/node\/61369\">Listen to a radio interview<\/a> with\u00a0waste picker representatives, Eva Mokoena and Steven Leeuw from Johannesburg about the\u00a0\u00a0impact of\u00a0 this troubling development.<\/p>\n<p>Aware of the potential introduction of the Separation at Source programme, WIEGO and waste-pickers have been asking Pikitup and the City to disclose and discuss the contracts since September last year, but to no avail.\u00a0 As a result, an Interim Johannesburg Reclaimers Committee (IJRC) was set up and in July waste pickers from seven regions of the City marched to protest outside Pikitup\u2019s offices.\u00a0 Eva Mokoena from the IJRC presented a Memorandum of Demands to the Managing Director of Pikitup on behalf of the Committee.\u00a0 See a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/GlobalRec\/videos\/1600425370030059\/\">video of the protest on Facebook<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>As a result of the campaign, Pikitup put a halt to signing any new contracts and acknowledged wastepickers as principle stakeholders in Johannesburg\u2019s waste economy.\u00a0Pikitup says that it is requiring the companies to include reclaimers, but it is leaving it up to companies that have no experience in integrating them to figure out how to do this and have not consulted with wastepickers on how they should be included. However, dialogue has now been opened up between Pikitup, the City of Joburg and the wastepickers, which is very much welcomed.<\/p>\n<p>For waste pickers, the four key pillars of integration are: <strong>recognition <\/strong>as workers providing public and environmental services for which they should be paid;<strong> inclusion <\/strong>in the current and future solid waste management system;<strong> consultation <\/strong>on all decisions affecting their livelihoods; and, all of the above to begin with the<strong> registration<\/strong> of all waste pickers in a centralised database to ensure that the integration\u00a0process is well planned, fair, transparent and able to be properly monitored.<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Negotiations to develop a framework of how the integration process will be implemented\u00a0have been underway for the past three months.<\/p>\n<p>See the <a
