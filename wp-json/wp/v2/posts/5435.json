The afternoon saw seven speakers delivering thought-provoking presentations before engaging in lively discussions with delegates from all over the Commonwealth. The working descriptor for the session was:<\/p>\n<p><em>\u2018everyone agrees UHC is a good thing, and governments have committed to UHC as part of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). But UHC cannot be achieved without sustainable financing, a sufficient health workforce, and equitable access to safe, quality, and affordable medicines for every citizen\u2019.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The CPA co-ordinated the health workforce section of the afternoon\u2019s programme. Seven recommendations drafted after the CPF in London the previous month were further refined as a result of expert input and discussions. These were presented by the CHPA to the Commonwealth Health Ministers at CHMM the following day.<\/p>\n<p>https:\/\/twitter.com\/FIP_org\/status\/998515018667909123<\/p>\n<p>The CHPA also conducted a survey via their networks to request feedback on these recommendations from a wider audience. As a result of this, further refinement was achieved and the CPA was delighted that recommendation three (below) specifically referenced the need for governments to not only address \u2018access to effective, quality and affordable essential medicines\u2019 but also recognised the essential role pharmacy plays in this aspect of achieving UHC by specifically highlighting the need to invest in developing a \u2018sufficient pharmacy workforce\u2019:<\/p>\n<p><em>\u00a0<\/em><em>Recommendation 3:<\/em> that Commonwealth governments include in their UHC plans strategies for:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for their populations<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>Building capacity through education and training for a sufficient pharmacy workforce<\/em><\/li>\n<li><em>Developing public procurement policies using public financing<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Thank you to everyone that responded to our requests to answer the survey \u2013 your collective voice certainly made an impact and strengthened our advocacy efforts.

The meeting began with opening remarks by the Chair, Hon. Rosy Sofia Akbar, Minister of Health, Fiji and the Rt Hon. Patricia Scotland QC, Commonwealth Secretary-General. Following this, Mrs Gra\u00e7a Machel DBE, co-founder of The Elders delivered the keynote, where she referred to the \u2018fundamental right of health and well-being for all\u2019, as an essential component for vibrant communities and the development of nations. After lunch Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, World Health Organisation Director-General continued these discussions in the same vein, focusing on the importance of Commonwealth collaboration in enhancing the global fight against NCDs in the context of UHC.<\/p>\n<p>The Commonwealth Health Ministers engaged in discussion and debate throughout the day around challenges affecting their nations as they strive to make SDG3 and UHC a reality for their populations. There was particular emphasis on measures to encourage environments where healthy diets and exercise would promote wellness and help tackle the NCD epidemic through prevention.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Bold proposals were discussed at the <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/Commonwealth?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Commonwealth<\/a> Health Ministers Meeting (<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/CHMM?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#CHMM<\/a>) including one-stop crisis centres for victims of <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/gender?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#gender<\/a>-based violence and an acceleration of universal health coverage (<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/UHC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#UHC<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p>Find the story and communique here: <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/Gb8WIenH1L\">https:\/\/t.co\/Gb8WIenH1L<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/NffGvRzyUv\">pic.twitter.com\/NffGvRzyUv<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&mdash; The Commonwealth (@commonwealthsec) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/commonwealthsec\/status\/999681765810765824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 24, 2018<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<p>The UK\u2019s Secretary of Health and Social Care, Rt Hon Jeremy Hunt reiterated the British government\u2019s commitment to health outlined in the 2018 CHOGM Communique, part of which was directly linked to and provided a basis for the programme of the CSF the previous day:<\/p>\n<p><em>\u2018Commonwealth Heads agreed to achieve compliance with International Health Regulations, accelerate UHC, including through sustainable financing, strengthening health systems and integrated services which promote prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment and palliative care.
