Here&#8217;s what she found.<\/h3>\n<p>The status of women in Africa as a whole, and the extent to which the regulatory environment promotes gender equality across different spheres of life, provides an important backdrop for understanding and addressing gender imbalances\u00a0 in land and investment governance. Moreover, patriarchal attitudes and practices persist, particularly in rural areas, which means that women continue to be marginalised in terms of access to land and productive resources.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/akinamamawaafrika.org\/index.php\/publications\/research-reports\/111-securing-womens-land-rights-in-the-new-wave-of-land-acquisitions-in-malawi-swaziland-and-zambia\">A 2017 study conducted by Akina Mama Wa Afrika<\/a> in Malawi, eSwatini and Zambia, with support from the FundFinity Grants, revealed that deliberate restrictions on women accessing, controlling and owning land are common to all three countries. The study also showed that most dominant legal systems are strongly gender discriminatory. This is attributed to an unenforced policy regime on land guided by patriarchal cultural beliefs that do not regard women as custodians of land, discriminatory laws and policies, expensive legal justice, and low representation of women in senior leadership positions, largely as a result of persisting patriarchal attitudes and practices at both community and household levels.<\/p>\n<p>Land is a critical tool of production and remains a social asset that is central to political and financial power, cultural identity and decision making. In Africa women\u2019s customary land rights are more vulnerable. Even where customary tenure systems recognise land rights of both men and women, women\u2019s names are rarely on the documents, making them more vulnerable to losing their rights.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_5753\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-5753\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-5753 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/commonwealthfoundation.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/IMG_0360-1-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-5753\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Patience recently met FundFinity Grants staff to discuss the progress of Akina Mama Wa Afrika&#8217;s project in partnership with the FundFinity Grants <a href=\"https:\/\/commonwealthfoundation.com\/grants\/strengthening-womens-voices-advocate-womens-land-rights-southern-africa\/\">&#8216;Strengthening women\u2019s voices to advocate for women\u2019s land rights in Southern Africa&#8217;<\/a><\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Study after study has shown that women\u2019s access to and control of land, and other productive resources, is central to ensuring their right to equality and to a decent standard of living. This is emphasised in Sustainable Development Goals 1 and 5. While Goal 1 recognises that to end poverty, it will be crucial to ensure equal rights to ownership and control over land, as well as equal rights to inheritance of productive resources (target 1.4), Goal 5 on Gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment calls upon governments to carry out legal and policy reforms to give women equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to ownership and control over land and other forms of property, financial services, inheritance and natural resources (Target 5a). Indeed, evidence shows that a woman who has land has a degree of security; she is less likely to tolerate domestic violence and is in a better position to leave a violent relationship and negotiate safe sex, so the importance of ensuring women\u2019s land rights goes far beyond economic security and access to resources to the imperative goal of ending violence against women.<\/p>\n<p>Why is it then that while women\u2019s land rights are well-recognised as an important pathway for achieving poverty reduction at individual, household and national levels, as highlighted above, many African countries continue to deny them ownership and control of land and other productive resources?<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8216;Land is a critical tool of production and remains a social asset that is central to political and financial power, cultural identity and decision making.&#8217;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/akinamamawaafrika.org\/index.php\/publications\/research-reports\/111-securing-womens-land-rights-in-the-new-wave-of-land-acquisitions-in-malawi-swaziland-and-zambia\">The Akina Mama wa Afrika study<\/a> showed that the situation of women and ownership of land has been worsened by the increased rush for large scale land acquisition by both international and national investors. While contexts differ, investor interest in large-scale land deals for agribusiness has raised commercial pressures on land and livelihoods across sub-Saharan Africa. \u00a0Admittedly such projects can potentially benefit local communities, but research suggests that investments can often have negative consequences on vulnerable groups, indeed women suffer disproportionately. This is because such investments tend to reinforce, or even exacerbate, existing attitudes and practices. Further denying women\u2019s access to land.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">In partnership with women\u2019s movements in Swaziland with support from <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/commonwealthorg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@commonwealthorg<\/a>, we sought to contribute to securing women\u2019s land rights in the wake of large scale land acquisitions.

The study reveals that Malawi, eSwatini and Zambia need to push for accelerated land reform, particularly to address the duality of the land tenure system which is governed by traditional and statutory norms. This should involve increasing access, control and ownership of land by women in order to address the historical injustices that women have faced over land. The research also points to the need to strengthen women\u2019s livelihood opportunities by increasing their ability to hold agricultural investors in their countries to account. This will not happen overnight and will require organising so that there is a critical mass of activists demanding policy change. This point was well articulated by one of the participants in the research project: \u2018land is power, and it won\u2019t be given away easily by those who have it. We need to build a strong movement so that collectively we take actions to challenge the barriers\u2026our voices from the ghetto must be heard. We need land: it&#8217;s capital and it&#8217;s life\u2019.<\/p>\n<p><em>Patience Ayebazibwe is Programmes Officer at Akina Mama Wa Afrika.\u00a0Women\u2019s Land Rights in the Wave of Land Acquisitions in Malawi, eSwatini and Zambia is <a href=\"http:\/\/akinamamawaafrika.org\/index.php\/publications\/research-reports\/111-securing-womens-land-rights-in-the-new-wave-of-land-acquisitions-in-malawi-swaziland-and-zambia\/file\">available for download here.<\/a>\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Patience Ayebazibwe\u00a0led research in\u00a0Southern Africa\u00a0on the policies and conventions governing women\u2019s access to land.
