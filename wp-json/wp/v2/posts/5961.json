Although there is a time for shouting and screaming and demonstrating.&#8221;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Ashley John (Constructive Solutions Inc) sees the Working Group as a means for civil society to regain its voice in parts of the Caribbean.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;One of the things that we have learned and we appreciate is that there are really no shortcuts. You have to be informed on your issues and what\u2019s going on around you \u2013 not only in terms of your local island, but in the region and globally. You have to frame that into all your advocacy because you\u2019re no longer stand alone. So this process has brought us on a par with global best practices.&#8221;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Sandra Ferguson (Inter Agency Group of Development Organisations (IAGDO) sees the group as &#8220;an excellent opportunity to learn about engaging more effectively. It also provides the opportunity for the regional to reach down to the national \u2013 so more synergy.&#8221; Ms Ferguson highlighted that members have been able to build their capacity in advocacy research, being able to draw on the knowledge and experience of others in the group. &#8220;This will also enable us to build the capacity of those engaged in the network, and also to expand it, as we think critical mass is important. For me, participatory governance is really about stakeholders \u2013 particularly our constituents or the marginalised \u2013 being part of the process of decision-making, of policy, of implementing, monitoring and designing.&#8221;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>[youtube https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rP7nWVF0UvM?rel=0]<\/p>\n<p>[youtube
