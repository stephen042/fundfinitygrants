They not only supported the development of my film, <em>Auntie<\/em> (2013), but they also premiered it in New Zealand and supported its screening at a variety of quite high-profile festivals. Due to the publicity and the conversations those screenings generated people started to tell me their own stories which then led me to say: \u2018Wait a minute, there is so much more than just the one story that I told!\u2019 A year after the film was out, Commonwealth Writers reached out and asked me whether I was willing to do some outreach which they offered to fund.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8216;For a wider audience, especially policymakers, hopefully the effect is that they perceive and understand an issue in a different and more powerful way.&#8217;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>What I created was <a href=\"https:\/\/barrelstories.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Barrel Stories<\/a>, an online oral history archive where I record and share the stories of people who have been affected by parental separation because of migration. The site also includes a list of resources and other work on the issue. Commonwealth Writers didn\u2019t hesitate in saying, \u2018How can we help? What do you need?\u2019\u2026They trusted me to pull it off and they helped me to understand my own process and the logistical and emotional pitfalls of getting involved with the recording of real stories. Out of that I developed a much deeper interest in non-fiction storytelling and two years ago I moved to the [United Kingdom] to do an MA in documentary.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_6587\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-6587\" style=\"width: 720px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-6587 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/commonwealthfoundation.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/LLPhoto-2-A-scene-from-the-short-film-Auntie-shot-on-location-in-Barbados.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"403\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-6587\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Auntie<\/em>\u00a0(Harewood, 2013) follows a\u00a0middle\u00ad-aged seamstress and respected caregiver in her rural Barbadian community<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Now I\u2019m in the process of developing this project across multiple platforms.

Can such stories impact the dominant narrative?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Lisa:<\/strong> As a person from the Caribbean I grew up seeing so many terrible depictions of Caribbean people. Usually as happy-go-lucky, \u2018everything is great, yeah man!\u2019 people. And it sounds like a really silly thing\u2026 but when someone says this is how your country is and this is how these people act and sound and it\u2019s not anything that you recognise, you feel really insulted and demeaned. Having other people tell our stories takes away so much from us if it\u2019s not done well. I\u2019m not saying that you can\u2019t tell a story from a community that\u2019s not your own. You can, but you have to do it with a great deal of sensitivity and a desire to get it right. So I\u2019m really glad to be a part of a generation of filmmakers and writers and artists who are taking control of our own narrative. We can have rich, fully rounded portrayals instead of damaging stereotypes.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve seen through my own work on <em>Auntie<\/em> and <em>Barrel Stories<\/em> just how amazing it is for an audience of Caribbean people to see and hear characters who they recognise. It\u2019s almost a clich\u00e9 to say people need to see themselves reflected but they do. It\u2019s one way for them to make sense of their own lives and experiences and their place in the wider world.<\/p>\n<p><em>Lisa Harewood is a film director.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Lisa Harewood on how making her first film with Commonwealth Writers enabled her to present a different view of the Caribbean and changed her career forever. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":50,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[388],"tags":[311],"cross_cutting_themes":[],"focus_area":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v23.5 -
