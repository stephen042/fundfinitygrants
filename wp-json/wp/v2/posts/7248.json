At the time we were full of optimism and hope that the global community could come together to address the defining issue of our age. It was with some trepidation that I travelled to Katowice with colleagues to hear about the progress had been made in the time since the Convention was ratified in 1994.<\/p>\n<p>The Foundation\u2019s delegation was joined by more than 33,000 delegates including heads of state, ministers, officials, businesses, the scientific community, and the widest range of civic voices. We converged on the city\u2019s vast conference centre, which symbolises the transition Katowice is making from a coal dependent town to one that increasingly looks to the service sector for its jobs. Perhaps this was why the conference strap line read \u2018Changing Together.\u2019<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8216;Will governments grasp this opportunity to convene and coordinate the multi-stakeholder approaches that are required? Will they put the &#8220;together&#8221; in changing together?&#8217;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>This was the 24th time that the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the Convention had met and this year the focus was on getting agreement on the rule book that should govern the way that countries go about achieving agreed targets. Small states \u2013 many of them Commonwealth members called for more ambitious targets when the parties met at COP23 last year. The UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was asked to provide scientific evidence that might support these more stringent limits on global warming. That report (Global Warming 1.5\u02daC) provided the backdrop to COP24. Its message was that more needed to be done and quicker. The science is clear.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7252\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-7252\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-7252 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/commonwealthfoundation.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/32306200508_497cd98bc1_o-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-7252\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">More than 32,800 delegates from around the world registered to attend this year&#8217;s event, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-climate-change-notebook\/katowice-cop24-notebook-protesters-raise-the-alarm-on-climate-idUSKBN1O70BE\">a record number<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Governments found it difficult to agree how the report should be received and what the rulebook should say. This only served to highlight the importance of multilateral spaces. The majority of national governments, municipalities, businesses and civil society organisations signalled their intent to accelerate efforts. Thinking about how should these coalitions of the willing operate focuses attention on implementing national adaptation plans and delivering nationally determined contributions (NDCs). NDCs are statements on how each country will reduce national emissions and adapt to climate change impacts. Those NDCs have to be more ambitious and are due to be shared internationally by 2020. The Fijian government as President of COP 23, last year introduced the concept of Talanoa, a Pacific process of storytelling that enables agreement and action. The Talanoa Dialogue was introduced as a means of helping countries to upgrade and act on their NDCs.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Speaking <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/COP24?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@COP24<\/a> on inclusion of civic voices as states set more ambitious targets and take urgent action on climate change <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/COP24?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#COP24<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/CWclimate?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#CWclimate<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/commonwealthorg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@commonwealthorg<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/RKjJ7j3EF5\">pic.twitter.com\/RKjJ7j3EF5<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Vijay Krishnarayan (@vkrishnarayan) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/vkrishnarayan\/status\/1073175447557627905?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 13, 2018<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">.<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/vkrishnarayan?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@vkrishnarayan<\/a> speaking at the high level segment of <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/COP24?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#COP24<\/a>: &#8216;Fairer, more inclusive and participatory governance are central to climate justice.&#8217; (6\/6)<\/p>\n<p>\u2014 Commonwealth Fdn (@commonwealthorg) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/commonwealthorg\/status\/1072960784613937153?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 12, 2018<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<p>Will governments grasp this opportunity to convene and coordinate the multi-stakeholder approaches that are required?
