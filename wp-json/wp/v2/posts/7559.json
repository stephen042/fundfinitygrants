It was a great feeling to meet a few of the pioneers who attended the same conference in Beijing in 1995 &#8211; still going strong and honouring us with their hallowed presence. But I was left wondering: Where is the vibrant African women\u2019s feminist movement that took charge after Beijing 1995? The movement appears to have subsided with time.<\/p>\n<p>Over the past two decades, the women\u2019s empowerment movement ensured that more girls and women secure their agency and claim their rights to voice, as well as access to education, health, shelter, and political representation. It catalysed progress and gains but has fallen short of a complete transformation. It was all because of the work of a few activists who braved the odds and spoke out boldly and firmly in deed and in fact against all forms of discrimination against women and girls.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&#8216;The women\u2019s empowerment movement ensured that more girls and women secure their agency and claim their rights to voice&#8217;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>My attendance at CSW63 was funded as part of an ongoing initiative of the FundFinity Grants which aims to revive, reconnect, and build a cross generational women\u2019s movement, celebrating past gains and inspiring a bold future. It is my hope that this initiative will nurture a new generation of highly motivated and skilled young African feminist activists to continue the struggle.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_7566\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-7566\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-7566 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/commonwealthfoundation.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/muslim-with-class-of-95-1024x767.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"479\" srcset=\"https:\/\/commonwealthfoundation.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/muslim-with-class-of-95-1024x767.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/commonwealthfoundation.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/muslim-with-class-of-95-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/commonwealthfoundation.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/muslim-with-class-of-95-768x575.jpg 768w, https:\/\/commonwealthfoundation.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/muslim-with-class-of-95-800x599.jpg 800w, https:\/\/commonwealthfoundation.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/muslim-with-class-of-95.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-7566\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Hazel Brown (left), feminist activist and pioneer delegate to the 1995 Commission on the Status of Women in Beijing, joined the activities in New York this month<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>About the CSW 63<\/strong><br \/>\nRepresentatives from 45 UN member states, UN entities and the ECOSOC-accredited non-governmental organisations from all regions of the world attended CSW 63. The key themes of the event were: social protection systems, access to public services and sustainable infrastructure for gender equality, and the empowerment of women and girls. The programme was in line with global need: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.unwomen.org\/en\/news\/stories\/2019\/3\/press-release-csw-63-delivers-roadmap-on-ensuring-womens-social-protection\">these thematic areas<\/a> remain the major barriers to the full and effective participation of women in their societies.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&#8216;We may have won some battles but the war towards a free and gender equal world is far from over.&#8217;<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Push back against the push back<\/strong><br \/>\nThe new buzz-phrase for me is to \u2018push back against the push back\u2019. After so much work on women empowerment and equality, there seems to be a global push back against women\u2019s rights issues and in some cases an erosion of the gains &#8211; in political participation for example. Women\u2019s rights organisations and their allies must rise up and redouble their efforts to rebuild the movement. The UN Chief, Antonio Guterres, acknowledged this when he said \u2018power is not given, power is taken\u2019 (Mr. Guterres said this at a town hall meeting that Executive-Director of UN Women,\u00a0Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, had chaired and opened with song).<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">On the <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/InternationalDayofHappiness?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#InternationalDayofHappiness<\/a>, look back at one of the most joyful moments of <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/CSW63?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#CSW63<\/a> when Executive Director <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/phumzileunwomen?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@phumzileunwomen<\/a> led women&#8217;s rights activists in song ? <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/85VVHgx3Jn\">pic.twitter.com\/85VVHgx3Jn<\/a><\/p>\n<p>\u2014 UN Women (@UN_Women) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/UN_Women\/status\/1108361297366675456?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 20, 2019<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<p><strong>Registering my presence at CSW 63<\/strong><br \/>\nAt that same lively town hall meeting, I tried to catch the attention of Ms. Mlambo-Ngcuka, but to no avail. And so in the spirit of Mr. Guterres\u2019 words, I approached him as he left the hall. In the few seconds I had, I urged the UN Chief to look into the challenges the movement faces. My argument \u2013 as it has been throughout \u2013 was that without a deepening collaboration between the media and the women\u2019s movement, they will at best remain mere purveyors of news, rather than proactive shapers of new narratives and realities.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Didn&#8217;t get a chance to make my point at d town hall with <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/antonioguterres?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@antonioguterres<\/a> so I &#8216;accosted&#8217; him &amp; made a case for African women in media.

Giving agency to these different voices is key to local advocacy and implementation of action plans<\/li>\n<li>It was sad to learn that women\u2019s political participation has regressed; we must push back<\/li>\n<li>There is an urgent need to ensure women\u2019s access to social protection systems, public services and sustainable infrastructure to level the playing field<br \/>\nAfrica and Ghana have even greater challenges in meeting these ideals, and must work to revive and rebuild a cross generational movement of young and old feminist activists to maintain pressure on power.<\/li>\n<li>I was inspired by the conversation about youth and rural women\u2019s participation as well as conversations to include men and boys on the agenda<\/li>\n<li>My suggested key action points for African and Ghanaian participants are: mobilise to organize press interactions back home on the outcomes of the CSW63 meetings;\u00a0 issue statements to government agencies highlighting the gaps in existing programmes on women empowerment and equality; organize intergenerational dialogues aimed at revamping the women\u2019s movement and including newer, younger, or excluded voices; continue public awareness campaigns to increase knowledge and shape better attitudes towards women and girl\u2019s rights.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>My concluding advice, to all planning to attend CSW 64: by all means attend, but if you can: prepare, prepare, prepare. Above all be truly present when you are in the sessions and make many friends and contacts.<\/p>\n<p><em>Shamima Muslim is Founder and Convener of\u00a0a <a
