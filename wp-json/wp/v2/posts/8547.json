Experts met to form a regional picture of five key factors that contribute to the problem: 1) violence committed by intimate partners and other forms of domestic violence 2) inadequate number of shelters 3) delay in adopting regulations for the Sexual Offences Act in order to introduce a sex offender registry 4) low number of arrests for breaches of protection orders and 5) law enforcement officials\u2019 treatment of domestic violence cases. Later, at the CEDAW South to South Institute, we examined violence against women through the lens of human rights with a range of regional experts, activists, and advocates.<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_8553\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8553\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/commonwealthfoundation.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/WAMM-Day-2-54.jpg\" data-rel=\"lightbox-image-1\" data-magnific_type=\"image\" data-rl_title=\"\" data-rl_caption=\"\" title=\"\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-8553 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/commonwealthfoundation.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/WAMM-Day-2-54-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" srcset=\"https:\/\/commonwealthfoundation.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/WAMM-Day-2-54-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/commonwealthfoundation.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/WAMM-Day-2-54-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/commonwealthfoundation.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/WAMM-Day-2-54-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/commonwealthfoundation.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/WAMM-Day-2-54-800x533.jpg 800w, https:\/\/commonwealthfoundation.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/WAMM-Day-2-54.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-8553\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Flexibility around time slots for working groups ensured all participants were able to provide input and arrive at a consensus.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Despite everyone\u2019s best efforts to prepare for big international meetings, they carry the risk that some voices will drown out others.

As Small Island Developing States grappling with climate inaction, we naturally identified with Pacific Islanders and formed new alliances. But we also benefited from local experience too: I won\u2019t forget the rich experience of being welcomed at the Maasai community in Kajiado, 80 km south of Nairobi, where I saw, first-hand, the exceptional work being done by a local community organisation to address women\u2019s economic empowerment and leadership.
