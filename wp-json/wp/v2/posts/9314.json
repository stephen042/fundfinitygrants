The participants, who hailed from 11 Commonwealth countries and had each received support from our grants programme, shared strategies and approaches to realise these rights by making governments more accountable;\u00a0this is the second in a series of blogs profiling the case studies our partners shared.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>The evidence is unambiguous: vulnerable and marginalised groups\u2014including women and girls, the poor, and persons with disabilities (PwDs)\u2014are very far from achieving the promise of universal health coverage or the Sustainable Development Goal of ensuring\u00a0<\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/sustainabledevelopment.un.org\/sdg3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em><strong>healthy lives and wellbeing<\/strong><\/em><\/a><em>\u00a0for all.

The COVID-19 pandemic has made these inequalities starker.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Coalition building can be a powerful force for change, not least because coalitions of like-minded organisations working towards a common purpose provide greater visibility for a cause by engaging groups across society. As the following case studies demonstrate, those within a coalition also share information and pool their skills, vastly increasing their potential to create and sustain change.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Two case studies from Kenya<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/andy.or.ke\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Action Network for the Disabled<\/a> (ANDY) is a Disabled Persons Organisation (DPO) in Kenya. They are working in partnership with <a href=\"https:\/\/ablechildafrica.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Able Child Africa<\/a> to realise the rights of children and young people with disabilities.<\/p>\n<p>ANDY builds coalitions at both the national and community levels in Kenya.<\/p>\n<p>The National Disability Coalition brings together disability rights activists with other civil society groups working on related issues such as education, health, and employment. The coalition builds relationships with decision-makers. It also establishes nationwide policy priorities, key messages, and raises awareness of disability rights issues.<\/p>\n<p>At the community level, ANDY identifies informal groups that are organising around an issue. For instance, the Sagana Disabled Self-Help Group in Kirinyaga county is an informal collection of businesspeople with disabilities who are looking for ways to make the business environment more disability-friendly, including through seeking exemptions from business fees. Such groups, which ANDY calls disabled people\u2019s groups, have a detailed understanding of the local needs of people with disabilities but often lack the capacity to engage government on matters of policy. ANDY and other civil society organisations in the network build their partners\u2019 skills in advocacy, fundraising, and collecting evidence. They then connect the disabled people\u2019s groups with the relevant decision-makers in the network.<\/p>\n<p>This strategy has proven effective. For example, a disabled people\u2019s group in Machakos county worked with a number of formal organisations in the network to improve the accessibility of local buildings and, together, they managed to successfully lobby the county government to pass the necessary legislation. In another example, in Kirinyaga county, ANDY connected a disabled persons group working to protect children with disabilities from abuse to the government\u2019s local children\u2019s officer. They now work regularly together to resolve cases.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Using Community Champions<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.kelinkenya.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">KELIN\u2019s<\/a> mission is to improve the quality of life for people living with HIV by making sure the government meets its commitment to protect their health and wellbeing. A fundamental part of their strategy is to build the capacity of people living with HIV to collaborate.<\/p>\n<p>KELIN use a two-step process. First, they identify all relevant non-government stakeholders in an area\u2014this includes people living with HIV, communities affected by HIV, health providers, civil society organisations, community-based organisations, and media with an interest in health issues. They then bring the groups together for a two-day training and networking session. Those involved are provided with information on the rights of people living with HIV and how decisions are made by government. They then develop work plans based on the priorities they agree on, as well as the most appropriate methods for engaging relevant decision-makers.<\/p>\n<p>At the end of the event, the group selects a sub-group of Community Champions who meet on a quarterly basis. Community Champions continue to identify and prioritise the most important issues throughout the year to ensure the coalitions\u2019 advocacy strategy is responsive to evolving needs. For example, Community Champions in Mombasa noticed that women with HIV or TB were being detained in a health facility after giving birth, due to non-payment of hospital charges. The coalition met formally with officials at the facility to point out that the practice of detainment was not in line with the government\u2019s stated commitment to free maternal services. This led to the head of the health facility working with their team to eliminate the practice.<\/p>\n<p>KELIN has found that building coalitions in this way leads to sustainable change. For example, involving journalists in the coalition results in coverage and raised public awareness. Community Champions gradually develop the confidence and know-how for independent advocacy. And the government also begins to see the value in regular community feedback. This is well illustrated in Mombasa, where local officials now invite Community Champions to join regular working groups so they can provide input on policy and practice.<em>\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Dr Shobha Das is a former Director of Programmes at Minority Rights Group International and Gillian Cooper is the Programme Manager of Knowledge, Learning, and Communications at the FundFinity Grants.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Coalitions bring visibility to a cause, share information and pool skills\u2014vastly increasing their potential to create and sustain change.
