The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these inequalities.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Civil society plays a critical role in promoting and protecting health and disability rights. Civil society groups can, for example, hold their governments to account in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hurights.or.jp\/archives\/other_publications\/section1\/pdf\/Principles%2C%20Rights%2C%20Duty%20and%20Pedagogy.pdf#page=4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">respect of rights<\/a> enshrined in national legislation and the constitution. International treaties can also provide a valuable framework for advocating for improved protection of rights including through changes to domestic law and policy.<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>Alternative reports to the international treaty bodies<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Shanta Memorial Rehabilitation Centre (SMRC) has been gathering grassroots data on disability for years in partnership with civil society organisations throughout India. Their data is consistent with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.un.org\/development\/desa\/disabilities\/issues\/women-and-girls-with-disabilities.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">UN\u2019s findings<\/a>: women with disabilities face more obstacles than their male counterparts and struggle to access \u2018adequate housing, health, education, vocational training and employment\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>In 2019, SMRC and its partners submitted an alternative report to the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). This is a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.newtactics.org\/using-shadow-reports-advocacy\/using-shadow-reports-advocacy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">process<\/a> which enables civil society to provide an alternative point of view to the official reports submitted by governments under international treaties. The report, which was presented by a group of women with disabilities, contained <a href=\"https:\/\/tbinternet.ohchr.org\/_layouts\/15\/TreatyBodyExternal\/Countries.aspx?CountryCode=IND&amp;Lang=EN\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">33 recommendations<\/a>.

Many of the report\u2019s findings and recommendations were cited when the CRPD reported back to the Indian Government at the conclusion of the review process.<\/p>\n<p>The report, along with the remarks of the committee, were later disseminated to communities and disabled persons organisations in India. SMRC provided training on how to use the documents for advocacy purposes, thereby helping to create a groundswell of grassroots campaigning. Hundreds of people with disabilities are now reaching out to officials in their own states and pressing for change. Some trainees have even approached the courts where they feel government action is either not forthcoming or too slow.<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>Review and reform<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Research that took place in 2012-13 found that mental health legislation in the Seychelles and Botswana was outdated and ignored advances in care and treatment, denying those living with mental health problems their basic rights. The Commonwealth Nurses and Midwives <a href=\"https:\/\/www.commonwealthnurses.org\/index1.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Federation<\/a> and its partners established a National Mental Health Advisory Committee (NMHAC) in each country that involved civil society representatives and government officials. The job of these committees was to review existing legislation, prepare guidelines for law reform, and educate stakeholders and the public on mental health issues.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8216;the central mental health law was focussed on keeping the mentally ill in custody and excluding them from society&#8217;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In the Seychelles, the government had ratified the Convention on Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). The job of the newly-formed Committee was, therefore, to help ensure domestic legislation was up to the new standard agreed to by the government through its ratification of the treaty. The Committee\u2019s review revealed substantial gaps and weaknesses and it confirmed that new domestic legislation was required. A new mental health act went before Parliament in 2018 and was enacted into law in the National Assembly in May 2020.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike the Seychelles, Botswana has not become party to the CRPD. However, Botswana\u2019s constitution affirms the right to life, to personal liberty and freedom, as well as freedom from inhumane treatment and discrimination. The National Mental Health Advisory Committee\u2019s analysis identified numerous violations of these fundamental rights. Because the central mental health law was focussed on keeping the mentally ill in custody and excluding them from society, the Committee decided that it could not be reconciled with a rights-based approach. In response, and using drafting instructions provided by the Committee, the Attorney General drafted a new mental health bill that will soon go before Parliament.<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>S<\/u><\/strong><strong><u>trategic litigation<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Where collaboration and dialogue do not work, civil society may use litigation to ensure governments implement their legal commitments. In 2015, the Kenyan government issued a Presidential directive for district education departments to collect the names of HIV positive school children and their guardians. Although the Directive was aimed at delivering more effective care, it exposed children to potential discrimination that could cause real hardship and adversely affect educational outcomes.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8216;it exposed children to potential discrimination that could cause real hardship and adversely affect educational outcomes&#8217;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Community representatives wanted safeguards to be put in place to protect individuals from having their HIV status known in this way. Efforts to lobby the government to change the Directive were unsuccessful. The Kenya Ethical Legal Issues Network on HIV and AIDS (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.kelinkenya.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">KELIN<\/a>), alongside a child rights agency and the families of two children living with HIV, brought a case against the government arguing that the Directive violated fundamental rights and freedoms in contravention of the Kenyan constitution.<\/p>\n<p>The High Court of Kenya ruled that the Directive did indeed breach the right to privacy and was in violation of the overarching guiding principle of the \u2018best interests of the child\u2019. It ordered all data to be anonymised so a person&#8217;s name could not be linked to their HIV status. In partnership with community leadership, KELIN continues to advocate for legal compliance with the court ruling, providing awareness-raising for schools and supporting schools\u2019 efforts to help children living with HIV.<\/p>\n<p><em>Next month in our blog series on health and disability rights accountability, we look at how our partners build multi-stakeholder coalitions to achieve their advocacy goals.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Dr Shobha Das is a former Director of Programmes at Minority Rights Group International and Gillian Cooper is the Programme Manager of Knowledge, Learning, and Communications at the FundFinity Grants.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How do you hold a government accountable for implementing its legal commitments?
