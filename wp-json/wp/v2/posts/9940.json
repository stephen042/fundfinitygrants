They discussed shared colonial legacies of dominance and violence and\u2014crucially\u2014how the Commonwealth can build a more just and equitable future.

As Darrion says, \u2018racism and \u201cothering\u201d also has an economic benefit for some people. These books raise the consciousness around this.\u2019\u00a0The first is <em>Capitalism and Slavery<\/em> written by the late Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, Eric Williams. Williams looks at the economic factors which contributed to the end of slavery in the British Empire arguing, contrary to mainstream narratives, that the Slavery Abolition Act of 1833 was based on economic necessity rather than any supposed moral awakening.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8216;Is the Commonwealth living up to its aspirations and values?&#8217;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The second is <em>Plantation Economy<\/em> by George Beckford, which has contributed significantly to economic thought in the Caribbean. It examines issues of underdevelopment, the significance of plantations to developing economies, and the influence of European powers and the slave trade. The third book recommended by Darrion is <em>Britain\u2019s Black Debt<\/em> by Sir Hilary Beckles. Beckles argues for reparations for the enslavement of Africans with a focus on the Caribbean, examining the movements that are advocating for reparations.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Kakembo Galabuzi<\/strong>, an environmental entrepreneur from Uganda, called for greater engagement from young people in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.un.org\/development\/desa\/youth\/world-youth-report\/wyr2018.html\">2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development<\/a>. \u2018It\u2019s important to understand our role in Sustainable Development and [how] we shape our ideas and actions towards achieving the set goals.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>Kakembo also encouraged us to watch <a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/hER0Qp6QJNU\" data-rel=\"lightbox-video-1\" data-magnific_type=\"video\">an interview<\/a> by Simon Sinek on Millennials in the workplace; \u2018I share this because it\u2019s important to understand and reflect on our weaknesses and forge a way to do better.
