Gender based violence is particularly problematic. While there has been increased representation of women in politics &#8211; Rwanda leads the world in women\u2019s representation in parliament at 61.4%, progress has been uneven.<\/p>\n<p>Until recently there was a lack of harmonized policies and legislation to deal with gender inequality across the region.\u00a0But in March 2017, the EAC Gender Equality and Development Act (also called the Gender Bill) was passed by the East Africa Legislative Assembly. While the Act awaits to be assented to by the Heads of States and to take effect nationally, there is a clear need for a harmonised framework for action, to track success, and to make cross-national comparisons.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Project<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The Eastern African Sub-regional Support Initiative for the Advancement of Women (EASSI) is monitoring the implementation of the Gender Bill at both the regional and national level to gauge progress toward gender equality.<\/p>\n<p>EASSI is a civil society network working through National Focal Point member organisations in eight countries of the region: Burundi, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia, Tanzania and Uganda. Its Secretariat is based in Uganda.<\/p>\n<p>The FundFinity Grants has supported EASSI\u2019s advocacy on the Gender Bill by enabling interaction between EASSI and members of the East African Legislative Assembly. The project also includes the development of a gender barometer which will provide an annual report that assesses progress of government\u2019s actions, such as formulating policies that remove gender based discrimination, guaranteeing women\u2019s rights, and providing the necessary services for the realisation of these commitments. These actions require financial resources, institutional mechanisms and accountability frameworks that should be integrated in national plans and budgets.<\/p>\n<p>Citizens views on government performance are a fundamental component of the barometer that integrates the use of a \u2018Citizen Score Card\u2019. The barometer offers evidence based information for holding governments accountable to their gender commitments.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Issue Gender inequality in the East Africa region is manifest at all levels: in the social spheres, at the domestic level, and in public institutions.
