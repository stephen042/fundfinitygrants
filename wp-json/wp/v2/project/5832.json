A survey conducted by Aware Girls during a previous FundFinity Grants funded project &#8216;Strengthening women\u2019s participation in governance in Pakistan&#8217; revealed some of the challenges that hinder women\u2019s participation in electoral processes, such as difficulties in accessing polling stations, lack of permission from families to take part in civic, political and electoral processes and having to vote according to male relatives\u2019 political decisions.<\/p>\n<h3>Project<\/h3>\n<p>Peace Direct and Aware Girls are strengthening the capacity of a network of women to engage with policy makers, state institutions and political parties to advocate for increased protection of women\u2019s political rights. This is being achieved by organising and building the capacity of a Women\u2019s Advocacy Network of 20 young women and supporting existing Citizens\u2019 Committees to advocate for women\u2019s political rights in order to seek ways to contribute to a better, more conducive environment for women\u2019s political participation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.<\/p>\n<p>The project is also raising awareness and mobilising young women and wider communities to increase public support for women\u2019s political participation; this will include radio programmes and peer-to-peer education activities by young women to promote women\u2019s participation in the general elections of 2018. By promoting dialogue and engagement between the network and Citizens\u2019 Committees and decision makers, like the Electoral Commission of Pakistan. The project will seek solutions to accessibility issues for women at polling stations, and advocate for the collection of gender segregated data on elections. They will also approach representatives of political parties, including senior party leadership to advocate for changes to parties\u2019 manifestos and practices to reflect support for women\u2019s political rights.<\/p>\n<p>By the end of the project, greater awareness of women\u2019s political rights would have been generated among young women and communities. The network of women is expected to have secured relevant skills and experience to continue to promote women\u2019s political rights after the project ends. It is hoped that advocacy initiatives by the network and the Citizens\u2019 Committees will contribute to a more conducive environment for women\u2019s participation in electoral processes in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, thus resulting in greater participation of women in the general elections of 2018.<\/p>\n<div id=\"grants-mailchimp\">\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.peacedirect.org\/\">Peace Direct<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>Aware Girls is young women led organisation from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa working for women empowerment, gender equality and peace in Pakistan.
