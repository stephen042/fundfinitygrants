Resources allocated to health need to be utilised in an accountable and transparent manner, thus ensuring that everybody, especially the most vulnerable, can access health services.<\/p>\n<h3>Project<\/h3>\n<p>Kenya Legal and Ethical Issues Network on HIV &amp; AIDS (KELIN) is building a network of knowledgeable civil society organisations (CSOs) Community Based Organisations (CBOs), the media and communities of persons affected by HIV and TB to monitor the implementation of the right to health commitments, including the availability and utilisation of resources allocated to health at county and national level. This includes participation in health planning processes at county level and the development of communications to inform stakeholders on health issues. KELIN is also facilitating constructive engagement between the network and decision makers, such as government officials at county level, to advocate for measures that can promote greater transparency and accountability in the health sector.<\/p>\n<p>This project builds on the \u201cInfluencing HIV Policy in Kenya\u201d project funded by the FundFinity Grants from July 2013 \u2013 June 2016. The project established and built the capacity of networks in key target counties to engage in local governance processes for enhanced and inclusive delivery of health services.<\/p>\n<p>Through the proposed project these networks will be expanded and further strengthened to monitor the implementation of the right to health. Network members are closely involved in the planning, implementation and monitoring of the project in order to promote ownership.<br \/>\nBy the end of the project, network members will have acquired skills and experience to enable them to continue to monitor the implementation of the right to health commitments in the long term.<\/p>\n<div id=\"grants-mailchimp\">\n<h2><a href=\"http:\/\/www.kelinkenya.org\">Kenya Legal and Ethical Issues Network on HIV &amp; AIDS<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>KELIN is a Kenyan civil society organisation working to protect and promote health-related rights in Kenya by: advocating for integration of human rights principles in laws, policies and administrative frameworks; facilitating access to justice in respect of violations of health related rights; and developing the capacities of civil society organisations and groups working to promote the right to health.
