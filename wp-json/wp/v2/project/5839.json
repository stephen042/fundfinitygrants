As part of its efforts, India has implemented the WHO\u2019s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. It has also adapted the Global Monitoring Framework on NCDs and set specific targets under the National NCD Action Plan, in order to reduce the number of premature deaths from NCDs.<\/p>\n<h3>Project<\/h3>\n<p>Health Related Information Dissemination Amongst Youth (HRIDAY), along with its partners from the Healthy India Alliance \u2013 A national coalition of civil society organisations (CSOs) working on prevention and control of non-communicable diseases NCDs &#8211; is engaging with multiple stakeholders to form a clear picture of the progress made by the government and mitigation strategies required to overcome any challenges faced in achieving the targets. This process involves establishing a task force under the auspices of the Healthy India Alliance that documents and maps key NCD indicators to capture and update evidence on progress, recommend solutions to address impediments to progress, and develop an NCD Accountability Framework.<\/p>\n<p>HRIDAY is facilitating consultations, round tables, forums and meetings and conducting a programme of concerted action focused on accelerating the implementation of the key steps first identified in the National NCD Action Plan. Policy briefs are being produced to inform decision makers at the national level on the impact of tobacco on economic and social development, and the need to strengthen national tobacco control policies. Monitoring and accountability reports are being made available to the Government and other stakeholders for use at the national and international review of progress on NCD prevention and control.<\/p>\n<div id=\"grants-mailchimp\">\n<h2>Health Related Information Dissemination Amongst Youth<\/h2>\n<p>HRIDAY, established in 1992, is a voluntary organisation engaged in awareness raising, capacity building, advocacy and research to promote informed health activism through multi-stakeholder partnerships to prevent NCDs. The organisation\u2019s main areas of focus are: tobacco control; diet and physical activity; diabetes, CVD and obesity prevention; alcohol control; road safety; mental health; and the environment. <strong><a title=\"http:\/\/hridayindia.in\/\" href=\"http:\/\/hridayindia.in\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">www.hridayindia.in<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Issue The Government of India is taking action and targeting the greatest risk factors contributing to non-communicable diseases (NCDs).
