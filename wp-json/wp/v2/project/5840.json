Although the Indian government has introduced a number of laws and policies that are specifically designed to promote the rights of tribal communities, more needs to be done to monitor the implementation of legislation and policy at the central and state levels of government. A network of Tribal Rights Fora (TRF) was established by Find Your Feet to do just this, but they need to be strengthened so they can effectively engage policy makers and make recommendations to the institutions responsible for implementing legislative changes.<\/p>\n<h3>Project<\/h3>\n<p>Find Your Feet is designing and implementing a tailored programme of capacity development for TRF members in leadership, advocacy skills and engagement with governance and the media. The project is also forging strategic partnerships between TRF members and other alliances and networks so they can campaign on issues of mutual concern and engage with the government\u2019s implementing bodies, particularly the National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs). The TRF will document incidences of rights violations, hold regular meetings with NHRI representatives, and contribute to NHRI procedures such as formal complaints, expert inquiries and fact-finding missions.<\/p>\n<p>By the end of the project, it is expected that the TRF will be able to independently engage in policy dialogue and decision-making alongside government institutions. It is also anticipated that there will be improved monitoring of legislation and tribal policies by NHRIs as a result of interaction and information sharing with the TRF.<\/p>\n<div id=\"grants-mailchimp\">\n<h2>Find Your Feet<\/h2>\n<p>Find Your Feet, established in 1960, works in South Asia and Southern Africa to mobilise local knowledge, skills and resources, so poor, rural families can find sustainable solutions to poverty, exclusion and discrimination.
