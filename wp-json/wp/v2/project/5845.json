The experience in India shows that women elected in local government have played a key role in addressing critical issues affecting them and their broader communities, such as education, water management, health and domestic violence. The Women\u2019s Reservation Bill, which was passed by the Upper House of Parliament in March 2010, is yet to be enshrined in law.<\/p>\n<h3>Project<\/h3>\n<p>Centre for Social Research is generating public and governmental support around greater representation and participation of women in national and state governance structures in India.<\/p>\n<p>The project is advocating for the passage of the Women\u2019s Reservation Bill, which seeks to reserve 33 per cent of seats in parliament and state legislative assemblies for women. Women\u2019s representation in national and state governance will promote greater equality in politics and support stronger representation of women\u2019s issues in policy.<\/p>\n<p>The project is engaging members of parliament and advocating with political parties to promote more opportunities for women in leadership structures. This is being achieved using direct engagement with officials, media campaigns and mobilising citizens to raise public awareness. It is hoped that by forming a block of parliamentarians committed to voting and advocating in favour of the bill in the Lower House, it will be tabled and passed before the project comes to a close.<\/p>\n<p>The project is fostering greater awareness and appreciation of women\u2019s involvement in politics.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Endorsed project title:<\/strong> Promoting greater representation and participation of women in national and state governance structures in India<\/p>\n<div id=\"grants-mailchimp\">\n<h2>Centre for Social Research<\/h2>\n<p>Centre for Social Research (CSP) aims to empower the women and girls of India, guarantee their fundamental rights, and increase understanding of social issues from a gender perspective.
