It is recognised that strategies must have a broad appeal. Jana Sanskrit is working with communities in Purulia district of West Bengal using interactive, theatre-based approach known as forum theatre.<\/p>\n<h3>Project<\/h3>\n<p>Jana Sanskriti &#8211; Centre for Theatre of the Oppressed &#8211; aims to sensitise students, teachers, parents and the communities in the region to reduce underage marriage, and improve the retention of girls in school. \u00a0Jana Sanskriti is helping communities improve their understanding of the law and use the available government support systems. The project is establishing women\u2019s and community groups to support affected families on a case by case basis. They are sharing the messages on the injustices of child marriage and the importance of girls\u2019 education via local media outlets to increase awareness.<\/p>\n<p>It is expected that the project will create better informed and supported communities able to appreciate and support girls\u2019 aspirations, leading to an improved retention of girls in schools. It is also anticipated that the project will build closer links between communities, teachers, government officials and the police, enabling them to work together to enforce the laws on the rights of young women in marriage and education, which will result in a subsequent reduction in child marriage.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Endorsed project title:<\/strong> Preventing child marriage in Purulia, India<\/p>\n<p><em>Photo: Flickr CC\u00a0Eduardo Sciammarella\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13.008px;\">Pushkar<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<div id=\"grants-mailchimp\">\n<h2>Jana Sanskriti Centre for Theatre of the Oppressed<\/h2>\n<p>Jana Sanskriti is a voluntary organization reaching more than 200,000 spectators each year through the performances of 30 satellite theatre teams in rural West Bengal, India.
