However, community awareness of the negative impacts on health and the environment is typically very low. In addition, data on air and water pollution levels is not made widely available, and Jamaican communities often find it difficult to access this information from state regulatory agencies.<\/p>\n<h3>Project<\/h3>\n<p>Jamaica Environment Trust (JET)\u00a0is working with a selection of groups from communities experiencing air and water quality issues to form community-led advocacy networks. These networks are engaging with the government\u2019s regulatory agency and other industry stakeholders to advocate for proactive disclosure of air and water quality data and an improved regulatory framework. The project is also conducting and sharing research on existing legal and policy frameworks in Jamaica and across the globe, to increase awareness and strengthen advocacy.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, community awareness of the impact of air and water quality on health and the environment is expected to improve, and the communities involved in the project will be better equipped to engage with the issues identified.<\/p>\n<p>The FundFinity Grants has awarded a grant of \u00a359,390 over 24 months.<\/p>\n<div id=\"grants-mailchimp\">\n<h2>Jamaica Environment Trust<\/h2>\n<p>Jamaica Environment Trust is a non-government non-profit membership organisation based in Jamaica.
