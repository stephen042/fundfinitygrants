This will be achieved by developing a strong and cohesive voice for older people across the country, bringing together key civil society organisations (CSOs) to advocate more cohesively for their improved access to services and their delivery. Strengthened collaboration between these groups at provincial, district and national levels will ensure that older people\u2019s issues brought to the national stage reflect grassroots concerns.<\/p>\n<p>It is expected that by the end of the project, CSOs will be in a better position to coordinate their work and engage constructively with government representatives to influence decisions on older people\u2019s issues at the local and national level.<\/p>\n<div id=\"grants-mailchimp\">\n<h3>HelpAge International<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.helpage.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HelpAge<\/a> helps older people claim their rights, challenge discrimination and overcome poverty, so that they can lead dignified, secure, active and healthy lives. They work with like-minded organisations in over 65 countries across all continents. They have an office in South Africa and have worked in the country for several years with local partners on a range of issues affecting older people. HelpAge will be responsible for the overall management of the project. It will be in charge of the capacity building component of the project and will provide technical assistance to the South Africa Older Persons\u2019 Forum (SAOPF) on documenting and delivering advocacy messages.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.helpage.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">www.helpage.org<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Follow <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/helpage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@helpage<\/a> on Twitter<\/p>\n<p>Like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/HelpAgeInternational\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HelpAge International <\/a>on Facebook<\/p>\n<p>Subscribe to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/helpage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HelpAge<\/a> Youtube channel<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"grants-mailchimp\">\n<h3>Partner organisations<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.saopf.org.za\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The South Africa Older Persons\u2019 Forum<\/a> (SAOPF) was established in 2005 by the South Africa Human Rights Commission.
