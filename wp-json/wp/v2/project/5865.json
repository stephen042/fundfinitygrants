This policy promotes refugee integration into society and participation in social and government processes. However, refugees are not integrating effectively into society.<\/p>\n<h3>Project<\/h3>\n<p>This project recognises that while services provided to refugees by government are important and help to alleviate pressing needs, a long term improvement in the situation will require that refugees themselves are able to influence the policies that affect them. This will be achieved by building the capacity of leaders of refugee organisations to better represent and organise their communities, and for these groups to design and implement issue-based advocacy campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>It is expected that the project will lead to refugee communities engaging in dialogue with the government, and building better relations with their host communities.<\/p>\n<div id=\"grants-mailchimp\">\n<h3>Lawyers for Human Rights<\/h3>\n<p><a title=\"Lawyers for Human Rights\" href=\"http:\/\/www.lhr.org.za\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lawyers for Human Rights<\/a> was established in 1979 (LHR).
