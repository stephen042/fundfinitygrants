ICWEA helps the women\u2019s groups develop strong knowledge of vital elements of a participatory process, including budgets and monitoring and evaluation, allowing them to shape the structures and debates. It will work with the groups to develop their confidence to open up the avenues through which they can communicate with other women\u2019s groups for more concerted policy advocacy and engagement at bi-annual meetings attended by district officials and key local organisations<\/p>\n<p>ICWEA has been building relationships within Uganda since it was first formed in 2005, feeding into health and HIV\/AIDS policy processes, addressing related issues and advocating for change for several years. Its continued push for direct engagement with these decision makers and legislators has the long-term aim of allowing women living with HIV to sustain their own advocacy efforts and continue to push health sector reforms long after the grant project is completed.<\/p>\n<p>[youtube https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=mESwNiZqDkc?rel=0]<\/p>\n<p>Follow<a title=\"Follow @ICWEastAfrica on Twitter\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ICWEastAfrica\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> @ICWEastAfrica on Twitter<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Follow<a title=\"Follow \/IcwEasternAfrica on Facebook\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/IcwEasternAfrica\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> \/IcwEasternAfrica on Facebook<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Issue Women living with HIV in Uganda are significantly underrepresented in the decision-making processes that affect their healthcare, their living standards and ultimately their lives.
