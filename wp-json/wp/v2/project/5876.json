Workshops and public forums around the region will be held, and partnerships with tertiary institutions will be forged to capture younger opinions. Network participation at OECD, UN and Commonwealth forums on tax will also be secured.<\/p>\n<p>Grass-roots groups, small and medium-sized enterprises, youth organisations, civil society organisations will all benefit from the increased visibility of fiscal policy, by having their voices heeded and from inclusive and constructive dialogue with government.<\/p>\n<p>A comprehensive communications strategy, will be developed so that the project can leave a sustainable legacy that will provide guidance and support for any and all Caribbean leaders, stakeholders and experts long into the future.<\/p>\n<p>Professor Rosalea Hamilton, founding Director of the ILE, is excited by the response to the project so far, especially from young people. She said, \u201cI am confident that this investment in deepening our democracy will enhance the growth of our human, social, and political capital and, in turn, will contribute to social and economic development in the Caribbean.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Follow <a title=\"Follow \/ile.institutelaweconomics on Facebook\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ile.institutelaweconomics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\/ile.institutelaweconomics on Facebook<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Issue Following the economic turmoil that many Caribbean nations experienced during the global economic downturn that began in 2008, it became clear that countries in [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":2935,"parent":0,"template":"","meta":{"_acf_changed":false},"tags":[315,383,323,336],"cross_cutting_themes":[],"focus_area":[699],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v23.5 -
