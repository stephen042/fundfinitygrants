The industry is under the spotlight, however, due to the prevalence of critical workers\u2019 rights issues such as discrimination and wage inequalities. This project will support constructive dialogue to help address these issues.<\/p>\n<h3>Project<\/h3>\n<p>The Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) is a leading alliance of companies, trade unions and NGOs; its members include major UK supermarkets that have sourcing relationships with the South African agriculture industry. To improve working conditions and secure the future stability of this sector, ETI is working with local partners the <a title=\"Western Cape Economic Development Partnership\" href=\"http:\/\/www.wcedp.co.za\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Western Cape Economic Development Partnership<\/a> and the <a title=\"Institute for Development and Labour Law\" href=\"http:\/\/www.idll.uct.ac.za\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Institute for Development and Labour Law<\/a> of the University of Cape Town.<\/p>\n<p>Pooling their collective experience, this group will bring together farm workers, civil society organisations, employer organisations and government institutions for the first time, to develop an innovative multi-stakeholder forum to address these issues through constructive dialogue between these different groups.<\/p>\n<p>This project will examine employer-employee negotiating methods, identify appropriate opportunities for fostering dialogue and build capacity within workers\u2019 groups to advocate more effectively for their members. The goal is to develop the trust and frameworks that are needed for effective dialogue between South African farm owners and their workers.<\/p>\n<p>ETI Executive Director, Peter McAllister, said: \u201cA successful agriculture industry is vital for South Africa, and for the supermarkets that buy its produce. I\u2019ve seen first-hand there is a need and interest in constructive dialogue where workers\u2019 issues can be raised and resolved through negotiation. The time is ripe to establish a suitable forum and we are grateful to the Commonwealth Fund for supporting this effort.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>[youtube https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZN-dYUI-Ju4?rel=0]<\/p>\n<p>Follow <a title=\"Follow @ethicaltrade on Twitter\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ethicaltrade\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@ethicaltrade on Twitter<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Issue South Africa\u2019s agricultural industry is increasing in prominence as a major economic driver for the country.
