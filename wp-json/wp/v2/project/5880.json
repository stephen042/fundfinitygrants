The pace at which the city\u2019s population is rising \u2013 due to both migration and birth rates \u2013 has outstripped its capacity to build sufficient housing provisions, leading to a rapid increase in informal settlements, with poor living conditions and unstable or non-existent community structures.<br \/>\nReall is leading a project that will focus on 40 low income settlements in Colombo, and look at how the people themselves can contribute to improving the environments in which they live. The project will set up community development councils (CDCs) \u2013 a group of office bearers elected by households in the community \u2013 to act as representative bodies who will help the communities to work with governmental bodies and drive structured development of sanitation, water and other vital infrastructure.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" alignright size-full wp-image-1850\" style=\"float: right;\" title=\"Settlement upgrades in Colombo, Sri Lanka\" src=\"https:\/\/commonwealthfoundation.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/Improvement-of-2-toilets-at-No-half-A-Settlement-Kadirana-Watta_before%2Bafter.jpg\" alt=\"Settlement upgrades in Colombo, Sri Lanka\" width=\"827\" height=\"315\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Project<\/h3>\n<p><a title=\"Reall\" href=\"http:\/\/reall.xyz\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Reall<\/a> (formerly <a title=\"Homeless International\" href=\"http:\/\/www.homeless-international.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Homeless International<\/a>) is setting up community development councils to give the people of Colombo the knowledge, the skills and the voice to help them transform the conditions and services in the settlements in which they live. Through participatory decision-making and community empowerment, the project will give the people of Colombo the knowledge, the skills and the voice to help them transform the conditions and services in these settlements.<\/p>\n<p>Jenny Hyde, the International Programmes Officer at Reall, explained, \u201cBy replicating tested approaches from other communities, the project will mobilise communities into CSOs, develop their capacity to initiate basic service delivery within their communities and facilitate working partnerships with government, leading to improved housing and basic services in targeted communities. Using a community-driven approach to design and deliver infrastructure promotes a strong sense of ownership, which in turn will ensure long-term maintenance of the facilities.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The project is being implemented by Reall\u2019s long-term partner in Sri Lanka, <a title=\"Sevanatha Urban Resource Centre\" href=\"http:\/\/www.sevanatha.org.lk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sevanatha Urban Resource Centre<\/a>, in association with the <a title=\"Sri Lanka Women's Coop\" href=\"http:\/\/www.slwb.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sri Lanka Women&#8217;s Coop<\/a>.
