In India, carers \u2013 like elsewhere in the world \u2013 are often unheralded and are usually unpaid family members.<\/p>\n<h3>Project<\/h3>\n<p><a title=\"Carers Worldwide\" href=\"http:\/\/www.carersworldwide.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Carers Worldwide UK <\/a>is supporting carers in India, who are mostly women, to advocate for the social provisions and protection needed to reduce their vulnerability to impacts such as reduced earnings, poor health and loss of education. Carers Worldwide is partnering with socially-focused CSOs in Jharkand, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, to build on the lessons of an earlier advocacy pilot project, which highlighted the importance of helping carers through participatory processes such as group-led actions. The pilot has already achieved a number of important outcomes \u2013 including establishing self-help groups that have allowed carers to come together for the first time, participation in a government-run livelihood scheme and raising their profile with local government officials &#8211; and this project aims to help take that work even further.<\/p>\n<p>The carers most affected by poverty in each of the three districts will receive livelihood and training options compatible with caring and will learn engagement and advocacy skills, to allow them to participate in their own development. The project will also support district level Carers\u2019 Associations, allowing people to communicate with peers and giving them a platform through which they can make their issues known to development and district government agendas.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis project is creating the first opportunity for carers to come together, be seen and make their voices heard,\u201d explained Anil Patil, the founder and executive director of Carers Worldwide. \u201cThis is a huge step forward for this vulnerable group who, until now, have been unrecognised by their communities and the wider society. In partnership with <a title=\"NBJK\" href=\"http:\/\/nbjk.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NBJK<\/a>, SACRED and <a title=\"Samuha\" href=\"http:\/\/www.samuha.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Samuha<\/a>, we believe we will achieve significant change for marginalised carers over the next three years, transforming the lives of them and their families as well as laying firm foundations for a carers\u2019 movement across India.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>[youtube https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=GZRBuhvtrMg?rel=0]<\/p>\n<div id=\"grants-mailchimp\">\n<h3>Carers Worldwide<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Carers Worldwide works with carers in developing countries.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It aims to improve support, services and recognition for anyone living with the challenges of caring for a family member or friend who is ill, frail, disabled or has mental health problems.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.carersworldwide.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>www.carersworldwide.org<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Follow <a title=\"Follow @CarersWorldwide on Twitter\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CarersWorldwide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@CarersWorldwide on Twitter<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Follow <a title=\"Follow \/CarersWorldwide on Facebook\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/CarersWorldwide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\/CarersWorldwide on Facebook<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Issue The need for long-term care for people with chronic illnesses and disabilities is universal, and the rapidly increasing demand is an urgent challenge facing [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":1848,"parent":0,"template":"","meta":{"_acf_changed":false},"tags":[312,373,334],"cross_cutting_themes":[],"focus_area":[699],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v23.5 -
