Women are often marginalised, left out of critical policy debates and have limited access to resources. While there is a need for greater investment in agriculture, there is currently no recognition of the productive role of women farmers.<\/p>\n<h3>Project<\/h3>\n<p>With this grant from the FundFinity Grants, the Caribbean Policy Development Centre (CPDC) aims to enhance women\u2019s capacity for advocacy, contributing to an increase in the livelihood opportunities available, particularly through emerging opportunities in the green economy.<\/p>\n<p>It will provide an opportunity for women farmers to develop their advocacy skills to shape policy debates around the green economy in the Caribbean, resulting in a strong model for replication in other contexts. The project also responds to the 2013 Commonwealth Theme &#8216;Opportunity through Enterprise&#8217;.<\/p>\n<div id=\"grants-mailchimp\">\n<h3>Caribbean Policy Development Centre (CPDC)<\/h3>\n<p><strong>CPDC is a coalition of Caribbean non-governmental organisations.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It was established in 1991 to raise awareness about key policy issues among NGOs and the general public and to impact on policy decisions which put the interests of Caribbean people at the centre of their development strategy. Since its inception, CPDC has lobbied regional and international governments on behalf of Caribbean citizens whose voices are less heard. In doing so, CPDC has become accepted as a significant social partner in the development of the region where it has extensive experience and reach.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.cpdcngo.org\/cpdc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>www.cpdcngo.org\/cpdc<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Follow <a title=\"Follow @cpdcngo on Twitter\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cpdcngo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@cpdcngo on Twitter<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Follow <a title=\"Follow \/CPDCngo on Facebook\" href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/CPDCngo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\/CPDCngo on Facebook<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Issue While women have made giant strides in some male-dominated occupations, they still represent a small proportion of workers in the green economy.
