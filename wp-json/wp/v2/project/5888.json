Many women are unable to mitigate the environmental effects, nor do they have access to local authorities who could help them address these issues.<\/p>\n<h3>Project<\/h3>\n<p><a title=\"Friends of the Earth - Ghana\" href=\"http:\/\/www.foe-gh.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Friends of the Earth &#8211; Ghana<\/a> is encouraging collaboration between women\u2019s groups and local authorities to work together to address environmental and livelihood concerns, contributing to sustainable development in Ghana. This FundFinity Grants grant will facilitate the collaboration of 250 women subsistence farmers and four NGOs working on environmental and agricultural issues across three rural districts.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately the project will be scaled up and replicated to benefit a larger group of farmers, helping them to adopt ecological agricultural practices, re-greening and restoring depleted land and water resources.<\/p>\n<p>This project aims to close the gap between remote rural communities and relevant policy makers, enabling women farmers particularly, to talk to local authorities about environmental change and strengthening their ability to engage in participatory governance.<\/p>\n<div id=\"grants-mailchimp\">\n<h2>Friends of the Earth Ghana<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Friends of the Earth &#8211; Ghana is part of a worldwide international network of environmental organisations in 60 countries.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It focuses on environmental, social and economic issues working to bring about sustainable and socially equitable development through community participation.
