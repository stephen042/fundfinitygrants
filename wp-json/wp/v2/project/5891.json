Community monitoring teams will be formed to monitor local government for improved transparency and accountability.<\/p>\n<p>The project will increase opportunities for dialogue between community members and elected representatives of local government authorities through citizen juries. Networking and sharing good practice will be encouraged, and in-kind grants will be given to fund small-scale community projects improving local governance. The project hopes to build on internationally accepted values of participation, inclusiveness, transparency and accountability which it hopes will result in community-led solutions to promote good governance. This project builds on previous work carried out by Sarvodaya to train community monitoring teams.<\/p>\n<p>Sarvodaya has created a membership fund of R10m together with a national volunteer base of approximately 10,000 members contributing to the strength of the project. It has a strong track record of delivering this type of work and has used the learning from other initiatives to develop this project.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div id=\"grants-mailchimp\">\n<h2>Lanka Jathika Sarvodaya<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Lanka Jathika Sarvodaya is Sri Lanka\u2019s largest people\u2019s organisation with 34 district offices and a strong volunteer base.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Starting out as a movement developed around a set of philosophical principles drawn from Buddhist and Gandhian thought, over the last 50 years it has become a network of over 15,000 villages.
