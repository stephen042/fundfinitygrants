Young people at clinics and community centres will be trained to host talk shows and facilitate events within the community, involving decision makers, policy stakeholders and other young people.<\/p>\n<p>This initiative will create more airtime for\u00a0programming on HIV and AIDS and train radio staff and youth mentors to engage with audiences more effectively.<\/p>\n<p>It will also create platforms for young people living with HIV\/AIDS to speak openly about their experiences. The project will facilitate feedback by involving decision makers and policy stakeholders. A curriculum for community radio stations and pop-up stations to engage audiences around HIV and AIDS will be developed and shared widely with other civil society organisations in Africa. The content will be distributed to local and national stakeholders via outreach activities, contributing to the learning component of the project. It will be delivered as part of a joint work plan with the government of Cape Town.<\/p>\n<p>[youtube https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EMFIFgh7GFc?rel=0]<\/p>\n<div id=\"grants-mailchimp\">\n<h2>Children\u2019s Radio Foundation \u2013 South Africa<\/h2>\n<p>Children\u2019s Radio Foundation is a registered not-for-profit organisation in South Africa, the UK and the USA, providing young people with the skills to make their voices heard.
